A record is a type of documentation file that consists of specific information about hosts and name servers!

Hereâ€™s the updated table with DNS resource records up to **TXT**:

| **DNS Resource Record Type** | **Description**                                                                 |
|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **A (Address) Record**        | Maps a domain name to an IPv4 address, directing traffic to a server's IP.      |
| **AAAA (IPv6 Address) Record**| Maps a domain name to an IPv6 address, similar to an A record but for IPv6.     |
| **CNAME (Canonical Name) Record** | Points one domain name (alias) to another canonical domain name.              |
| **MX (Mail Exchange) Record** | Directs email to the mail servers responsible for a domain.                     |
| **TXT (Text) Record**         | Stores arbitrary text, often used for domain verification and security settings (e.g., SPF, DKIM). |

This table provides an overview of the essential DNS resource records for basic domain and email management.
