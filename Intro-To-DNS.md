DNS (Domain Name System) allows us humans to keep track of websites and hosts by name instead of an IP address. Its like a contacts list for the internet in the sense that, you dont have to write the full IP address to get access to a website and can just write its name!

For example, lets say that you want to access someones LinkedIn web page. The full URL would look something like this (im going to show you mine):

Without A DNS (Domain System Name) you would have to type in the whole IP address to access the website. So to access my linkedIn page, you can simply type 'Aaliyana Adoley Mingle LinkedIn' for a smooth searching experience 👀

A DNS translates domain names to an IP address which is why we can jut type the name of the website and it will automatically load. Behind the scenes however, our computer is is working through the network trying to connect servers to our IP address. This simplifies navigation on the internet for its users and is essential for accessing websites and services
