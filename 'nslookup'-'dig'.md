We use DNS tools such as ' 𝗻𝘀𝗹𝗼𝗼𝗸𝘂𝗽 ' 𝗮𝗻𝗱 ' 𝗱𝗶𝗴 ' 🚀🚀🚀

'dig' stands for 𝗗𝗼𝗺𝗮𝗶𝗻 𝗜𝗻𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗚𝗿𝗼𝗽𝗲𝗿 and is flexible and much more detailed for creating DNS servers. The 'dig' command helps
troubleshoot and gather information about domain name resolutions which is needed for diagnosing various networking issues!

### The Server 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5df897d1-884d-4855-83e1-86f17d95a341)

This is the server that you are going through to get to where your destination is which means that this is your router, your internet provider is your local server 

### The Address 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cf66dfb3-899b-491e-8874-f8f51667e9f9)

The address is similar to the server however it specifies a port number ( In this case '53' uses DNS )

### The Non-authoritative answer
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8a428e74-4fa9-4a5c-83ab-998a1add3e66)

A Non-authoritative answer means that the response came back from a cache and not directly from the authoritative DNS server for google.com.

This is the address we take to get to google.com!

## So How Do We Use 'dig' in our terminal?? 🤔🚀

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4f0f22d1-6af3-4e9f-9486-aacdf671f2ef)

- 'dig' is a more powerful version of 'nslookup'
- you can use either 'nslookup' or 'dig' when you want to do DNS queries however the 'dig' command will give you more details which is why it is more powerful

## The Question Section 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/040f546a-d286-4ce9-a052-ace084705acd)

- The question section shows you the query that you have made.
- In this instance we have made a query to google.com

## The Answer Section
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5d017f50-5ab5-4f2f-9d8a-8d107885199d)

- The answer section comes back with a list of IP addresses associated with that domain!
- In this case however, we only have 1 IP address but its possible to have more than 1

#### Ps. These are examples of shorter versions to get the same info using 'dig'

And that is a Wrap of the two Networking tools that we can use to Debugg issues with DNS!! 🎉🎆
