Static routing is when you manually set up a specific path for data to travel between networks (This is ussually done by an admin).
Unlike dynamic routing, where routers automatically 
figure out the best path, static routing relies
on predefined routes that don't change unless you update them.

Think of it like giving your GPS one specific route to always follow when driving to a destination,
even if there might be better or faster ways. If the road is blocked or there's a faster option,
the GPS won't know unless you manually change the route. This is a simple analogy that we can refer to when understanding static routing

Dynamic routing is when routers automatically figure out the best path for data to travel between networks.
Instead of manually setting routes like with static routing, dynamic routing allows routers to share information with each other
and adjust the paths based on changes in the network.

Using the GPS analogy again, Imagine youâ€™re using a GPS, but instead of following one fixed route,
the GPS constantly updates the directions if thereâ€™s traffic, roadblocks, or faster routes available. The GPS adapts in real-time,
so you donâ€™t have to do anything manually. This is the same concept with dynamic routing, according to the conditions of the path will determine
how the data gets transported.
