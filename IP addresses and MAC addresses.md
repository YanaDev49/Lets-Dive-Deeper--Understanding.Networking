Firstly, an IP address stands for 'internet protocol address' and allows devices to locate and communicate with eachother over the internet or a local network. It is a unique number assigned to every device on a network like a computers address. We can think of it as a digital version of a home address for your device!

There are 2 different types of IP addresses. These are known as IPv4 and IPv6. 

An IPv4 address is a 32 bit address that is made up of four sets of numbers seperated by dots for example, (192.168.1.1) each number in an IPv4 address can range from 0 to 255. its used to identify devices on a network so they can communicate with eachother. IPv4 is the most common type of IP address used on the internet, However it is gradually being replaced by IPv6 due to limited available addresses.

## So, what is an IPv6 Address?

An IPv6 address is an 128 bit address (In a hexidecimal format) that provides a much larger pool of addresses, so there are enough for all devices in the world, now and in the future! As well as providing more addresses IPv6 also simplifies addresses and provides enhanced security features.

## Why are IP Addresses so important? 

IP addresses are essential for 4 different reasons: They provide unique identification, data routing, communication and global activity.

## Lets diver deeper into this!

ðŸš€ Unique IP addresses are assigned to computers, phones or servers. This is important so that it can be found and contacted by other devices!

ðŸš€ When you send or request information for example, loading a website, IP addresses help direct data to the right place. The network uses IP addresses to figure out where to send the data and how to get back to you.

ðŸš€ without IP addresses, devices would not know how to locate and communicate with eachother. This means that we would not be able to browse the web or use social media platforms and send emails!

ðŸš€ IP addresses allow billions of devices to connect and share information across different networks worldwide which is why they are such an important part of tech and our digital system as a whole!!

## So what is a MAC address?

'MAC address' stands for 'Media Access Control Adress' and they help devices identify eachother on a local network. They are very important for ensuring your laptop or computer connects to the right router and not routers that our outside of your proximity. its a permanent 48 bit address that is used to identify devices on a local network and NOT over the internet like IP addresses. Its important to make a clear differentiation between them to understand how they make up the networking system. 

And these are the concepts of both IP and MAC addresses!!
