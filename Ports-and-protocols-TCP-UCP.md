Ports & Protocols: TCP and UCD (Lnaguages that devices use to talk to eachother)

What are Ports? 

Ports are like doorways on a computer that allow different types of data to enter and leave through the same IP address.
The most common ports include port 80 for web traffic (HTTP), port 443 for secure web traffic (HTTPS), and port 25 for email (SMTP).
Ports help organise and manage different types of communication on a computer for example web browser, email programs, and other applications can all work correctly
at the same time.

What are protocols in networking?

Protocols are like rules or standards that define how data should be sent and recieved over a network. They make sure that different devices and software can communicate properly.
We can think of protocols as languages that devices use to talk to eachother.
Just like how people need to speak the same language to understand each other, devices and programs need to follow the same protocol to exchange data correctly

For example: HTTP: used for transferring web pages, FTP: used for transferring files, SMTP: used for sending emails.

In summary, protocols are the rules that ensure smooth correct communication between devices and software on a network.

Without ports and protocols, our network communication would not run smoothly!

conclusion and summary for both: ports ensure that data reaches the right application on your device while protocols ensure that the data is understandable and well formatted!

The Types of Ports!!

Did you know that there are different types of Ports?

Yep thats right! the main types of ports we will dicuss today is known as: TCP and UDP

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a8f79e40-6af5-45fc-9f29-b08f0be9b733)

'TCP' stands for 'Transmission Control Protocol' which is a set of rules that ensures data is sent and recieved reliably between devices over a network, like the internet.

Remember when we said that ports are like specific doorways on a device? TCP ports are are the same except they use the 'Transmission Control Protocol' to send and recieve data reliably over a network!

Lets have a look at the characteristics of TCP ports!!

üìç Reliable data transfer: TCP ensures that data is delivered accuarately and in the right order, even  if there are delays or network issues. checks for errors and controls flow of data to prevent congestion.

üìç connection orientated: Before sending data, TCP creates a connection between two devices, ensuring both are ready to communicate

üìç Port numbers: TCP uses port numbers (like 80 for websites or 443 for secure websites) to direct traffic to the right application or service device.

üìç common TCP Ports:

  üìå Port 80: Used for regular web traffic (HTTP).
  üìå Port 443: Used for secure web traffic (HTTPS).
  üìåPort 22: Used for secure remote connections (SSH).

   In summary, TCP ports help manage reliable organised communication between devices over the internet or a local network. 

   TCP is used when 2 devices need to exchange data back and forth (known as bidirectional communication) for example browsing emails and 
file transfers.

REMEMBER! TCP establishes  a connection to be made between the devices before it can work effectively, it lets you know when communication has been sent from one device to another.
