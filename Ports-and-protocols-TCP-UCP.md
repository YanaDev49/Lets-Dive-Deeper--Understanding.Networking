What are Ports? 

Ports are like doorways on a computer that allow different types of data to enter and leave through the same IP address.
The most common ports include port 80 for web traffic (HTTP), port 443 for secure web traffic (HTTPS), and port 25 for email (SMTP).
Ports help organise and manage different types of communication on a computer for example web browser, email programs, and other applications can all work correctly
at the same time.

What are protocols in networking?

Protocols are like rules or standards that define how data should be sent and recieved over a network. They make sure that different devices and software can communicate properly.
We can think of protocols as languages that devices use to talk to eachother.
Just like how people need to speak the same language to understand each other, devices and programs need to follow the same protocol to exchange data correctly

For example: HTTP: used for transferring web pages, FTP: used for transferring files, SMTP: used for sending emails.

In summary, protocols are the rules that ensure smooth correct communication between devices and software on a network.

Without ports and protocols, our network communication would not run smoothly!

conclusion and summary for both: ports ensure that data reaches the right application on your device while protocols ensure that the data is understandable and well formatted!

Did you know that there are different types of Ports?

Yep thats right! the main types of ports we will dicuss today is known as: TCP and UDP
