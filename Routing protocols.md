# Introduction to Routing protocols ðŸš€ðŸš€

Routing protocols are essential because they automate the process of determining the best route 
for data to travel accross the network.

So instead of manually setting routes, these protocols do all the work for us.
Routing protocols enhance your networking efficiency. This is because they help ensure that your data or network packages that you sent take the most efficient path.
This reduces congestion and improves overall network performance 

## Common Routing Protocols: OSF and BGP

- Starting with OSPF, this stands for 'Open Shortest Path First'
- As said in the name, OSPF finds the shortest path for data to travel and is used mainly for withib large organisations. It uses something called link state information to do this.
- It links information to make routing decisions, which means that it considers the staus of a network and the cost to use them.
- OSPF can quickly re-calculate routes when there are changes in the network.

- BGP stands for 'Border Gateway Protocol'. It is used to route data between autonomous systems. We can think of autonomous systems as large networks managed by single organisations.
- BGP uses what is knows as a path vector mechansism which means it maintains the path formation that gets updated dynamically as the network changes.
- Furthermore, BGP allows network admins  to define routing policies based on various attributes. This provides greater control ofhow traffic flows through the network.
