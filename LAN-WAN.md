Did you know that there are actually more than 10 different area networks?ðŸ¤”

Yes thats right! but today we will be focussing on the most common types known as LAN and WAN.ðŸ’¡

LAN stands for Local Area Network which is when the devices in your home or close by surroundings such as computers, laptops,
TV and smart phones all connect to the same Wifi! connecting other devices to your computer such as printers and bluetooth devices are also an example of LAN.
This allows them to share data, information and resources to one another due to being in the same
local network. Your home network would come under 'LAN' as it is specific to your home area and only
covers a small proximity of your surroundings.

What is WAN?

On the contrary, WAN which stands for wide Area Network which connects the whole world together with eachother for example, schools buisnesses and the internet 
so we can all share data and information from eachother world wide. This is so important to fascilitate communication among us all
and so that we can work together with others vitually over a solid network. Its like having social platforms for example instagram, Twitter or even LinkedIn!
A wide area network allows us to connect through these platforms via a network.

An Example Of Networking In DevOps!!

A solid example of how Networking works in DevOps is setting up and managing a virtual private cloud on a cloud provider like AWS!
This is because it demonstrates real-world networking like IP addressing, subnets and route tables by dividing the VPC into subnets, defining IP ranges using CIDR notation 
and the public subnet using a route table that sends internet-bound traffic through an internet gateway.

And that is the concept of LAN and WAN as well as an example of networking in DevOps!!
