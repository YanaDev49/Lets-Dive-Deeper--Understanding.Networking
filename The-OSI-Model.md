The OSI Model stands for 'Open Systems Interconnection Model' which is a framework (communication model) that explains how data moves from one computer to
another over a network. It breaks down the process into 7 layers, each with a specific job!!

A communication model provides a standard framework that simplifies the way devices and applications communicate over a network. These models ensure that all devices on the network can understand eachother!

The OSI Model provides application independence by seperating networking functions into layers as previously mentioned , where each layer does its own specific job without depending on others. This means applications (like web browsers, email, or games) can work on top of the network without worrying about how data is physically sent or routed
This is important and beneficial because the application only needs to worry about its own job e.g displaying a web page, while others handle tasks like data transport or error checking.

📲 Layer 1: Physical layer

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bad801a4-ba38-4f60-8c24-b6880b7c9576)


Layer 1 is the actual hardware (Cables, switches, fibre, hubs, repeaters) that sensds the data as electrical signals
                      Function: Transmits raw but stream over a physical medium
 
📲 Layer 2: Data Link Layer

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dd5d675d-c37c-4ce6-9991-b1139f51d002)


Layer 2 makes sure the data is sent without errors between two devices on the same network via by using MAC addresses, switch and bridges (e.g your computer to your router).
                             Function: This layer provides node-to-node data transfer and detects, possibly corrects, errors that may
                             occur in the physical layer. It ensures that data is transfered correctly between adjacent network nodes.
                             

📲 Layer 3: Network layer 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6bb613dd-944e-4d0d-a860-d7f87eb833ae)


Layer 3 decides the best path to send the data accross diffrent networks (e.g routing with IP addresses)
                  Function: Determines how data is sent to the recipient. Manages packet forwarding including routing 
                  through intermediate routers.

📲 Layer 4: Transport Layer 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c861caa8-8482-42bf-9894-0ed0cbcfa4c9)


Layer 4 ensures reliable data transfer between devices e.g using TCP or UDP.
                               Function: Provides reliable data transfer services to the 
                               upper segments and reassembles data 

📲 Layer 5: Session layer

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bb252d8f-4f5f-415c-8452-556e0ef58e7c)


Layer 5 manages the connection and communication beween two devices
                    Function: Mamages sessions between applications, 
                    establishes, maintains, and terminates conncections.(Components: session managemnt  protocols)


📲 Layer 6: Presentation Layer

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ebed9c48-0756-4e1a-b21c-509f4cb7f3b8)


Layer 6 translates data into a format that can be understood by application e.g encryption and compression.
                                    Functions: Translates between the application layer and the network ensures data is in a usable format

📲 Layer 7: Application Layer 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ee72d991-9e73-4790-9a7c-b4d31900770e)


Layer 7 is where the user interacts, like web browsers or email applications.
                             Functions: Provides network services directly to applications End-user layer
                             components: HTTP, FTP, SMTP

The TCP model is a simplified framework for how data moves accross networks, like the internet. it has 4 layers that describe how computers communicate with eachother.

𝗛𝗲𝗿𝗲 𝗔𝗿𝗲 𝗶𝘁𝘀 𝟰 𝗟𝗮𝘆𝗲𝗿𝘀!! 🚀

📌 Application Layer: Where users interact with applications (e.g web browsers, email).

📌 Transport Layer: Ensures data is sent reliably or quickly (e.g using TCP for relaibility and UDP for speed).

📌 Internet Layer: Routes data between networks (.e.g using IP addresses).

📌 Network Access Layer: Manages the physical connection (e.g cables Wi-Fi)

In summary, the TCP/IP model explains how data is packaged, sent and recieved over a network, from users application down to the physical network connection.

And these are the concepts that makeup both the OSI Model and TCP/IP model!!
