 - This is also known as your local host file and is something we may need when we are developing or testing networks locally.

 - This can be used to map domains to IP addresses

 - Takes precedence over DNS for specific entries (this means that it allows you to override DNS settings for certain domains by providing an
 - alternative IP) 

  ## How does all this work? 

  When you search up a domain in your browser, your computer first checks /etc/host file.
  If the domian is listed in the /etc/host file it uses the provided address instead of querying the dns server.
  This can be useful for testing development and trouble shooting.
