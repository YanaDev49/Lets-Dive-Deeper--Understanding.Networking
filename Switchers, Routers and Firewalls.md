Lets Dive Into The Concepts Of Switchers, Routers and Firewalls And Understand How They Play
                                 A Big Part In Networking ðŸ’¡ðŸš€

Key Networking Components:

Switchers, Routers and Firewalls are known as the key components of a network and without them, networks that fascilitate
all types of interaction and infrascructure cannot be produced.

What Are Switchers?

Switchers are a huge part of making up our Local Area Network! They are responsible for connecting
multiple devices within the same network like computers and printers for example. switchers fasciitate smooth transition of data from one device to another 
which ensures efficient communication. So the main purpose of switchers is to connect devices within the same network and managing data flow.

What are Routers?

Routers are devices that direct data traffic between different networks. They connect multiple networks such as a local area network to the internet and decides the best path for 
datapackets to travel across these networks. Routers ensure that data gets to the right place by directing traffic between networks which therefore fascilitates data transfer and 
communication.

what Is A Fire Wall?

A firewall in networking is lika a security tool that controls what data can enter or leave a network. it allows safe data through while blocking potentially harmful traffic by acting as a gatekeeper.
A firewall decides what data is safe to flow through the network and what data isnt by following certain rules that determine what data is allowed or blocked. These rules are based on things like IP addresses, Port numbers and protocals which
we will get into abit later!
